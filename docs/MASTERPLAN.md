# Planned Features

Currently, there are no additional features of parameter space partitioning
that can be implemented. Nonetheless, all suggestions are welcome. Keep in mind
that there are various features we will not be implementing - calculating volume
and burnout.

Some aspects of `psp` we would like to improve are: 

- enhancing performance
- adding various statistics for summarizing `psp` results
- finding methods to visualise `psp` outputs

## TODO

- :sparkles: `init` can be a matrix. Users should be able to define multiple jumping distribution.
- :zap: model evaluations should be able to happen in parallel
- :sparkles: connect to external databases
- :zap: allow sampling procedure where parameters are not uniformly distributed
